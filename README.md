## Motivation
The world of technology has altered human lives into AI generation. From the business analytics to the most sophisticated of autonomous vehicle, AI involves our daily life more and more. This project presents one of AI concepts as deep learning approach to detect the dog in video automatically. We can apply this concept to the another technologies more around our daily life ex: auto-pilot, auto-vehicle.

 



## TechStack used


- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)


##  Dataset


This dataset consists  __1 video__ 

The dataset were collected from the following sources:

* __Data Science__ 




## Features
A method to use the dataset from Kaggle to train the predication model by Artificial Neural Network. Also, we use the test_dataset splited from dataset and we use Google Colab to train our model and then we use the model we trained to classify the image we take. The result is good.  

## Results
#### Accuracy: 0.8435
#### Confusion Matrix

#### We got the following accuracy/loss training curve plot
